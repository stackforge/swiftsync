    """This middleware update container Last Modified meta

    LastModified is a middleware that add a meta to a container
    when that container and/or objects in it are modified. The meta
    data will contains the epoch timestamp. This middleware aims
    to be used with the synchronizer. It limits the tree parsing
    by giving a way to know a container has been modified since the
    last container synchronization.

    Actions that lead to the container meta modification :
    - POST/PUT on container
    - POST/PUT/DELETE on object in it

    The following shows an example of proxy-server.conf:
    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline = catch_errors cache tempauth last-modified proxy-server

    [filter:last-modified]
    use = egg:swift#last_modified
    # will show as X-Container-Meta-${key_name} for the container's header.
    key_name = Last-Modified
